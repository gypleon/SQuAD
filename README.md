# Hybrid learning for SQuAD Challenge
This project is inspired by [3] which accounts for the Machine Reading Comprehension task [1]. It is first a Tensorflow[2] implementation of [3], then a further exploration combing End-to-End MRC model with statistical inference model. The major intention of this project is to validate the power of integrating statistical inference into deep learning model on MRC task.
